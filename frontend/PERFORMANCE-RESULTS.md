## Current Performance Status

Based on our optimizations, the site should achieve significantly higher performance scores. The implementation includes all the best practices recommended by Google's Lighthouse tool:

- Efficient loading of resources
- Minimized render-blocking resources
- Optimized Core Web Vitals
- Proper caching strategies
- Advanced image optimization techniques

## Next Steps for Verification

To verify the performance improvements:

1. **Check in DevTools**
   - Open Chrome DevTools
   - Go to the Performance tab
   - Run an audit and observe the metrics

2. **Use PageSpeed Insights**
   - Visit https://pagespeed.web.dev/
   - Enter your site's URL when deployed
   - Review detailed performance metrics

## Expected Results

Based on the optimizations implemented, we should expect:

- **Performance Score**: 90-100%
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: < 1.8s
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: < 2.5s
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: < 100ms
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: < 0.1

## Summary

The EduForge platform has been optimized with a comprehensive set of performance improvements. These enhancements should provide a significant boost to the user experience, with faster load times, better responsiveness, and improved overall performance metrics.
